#### Originally designed to teach Alex python, thank you for your constant learning enthusiasm


#### Also created for coderbunker deep learning

This course is the basic deep learning course that follows closely on Jeremy Howard's course.fast.ai

#### Environment Installation

Follow the [installation instructions](https://raynardj.github.io/python4ml/docs/INSTALL)

Run the jupyter notebook on anaconda3 environment

Usual pre-requisites for the learning. 

```
python 3.6

numpy == '1.14.3'
pandas == '0.23.0'
tensorflow == '1.8.0'
keras == '2.2.0'
```

Other versions of above library will probably work

If you don't have any of these, try the following format in the command line:
```
~/anaconda3/bin/pip install keras==2.2.0
```
assuming your anaconda3 is at ```~/anaconda3/```
